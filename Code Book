#Codebook for Human Activity Recognition Analysis

##Overview
This codebook accompanies the R script used for processing and analyzing the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. The script performs data downloading, merging, transformation, and summarization to produce a tidy dataset.

## Data Source
The dataset is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains data collected from the accelerometers and gyroscopes of smartphones worn by subjects performing daily activities.

##Script Summary
The R script performs the following steps:

1. **Package Loading**: Loads the required `dplyr` and `tibble` packages for data manipulation.

2. **Data Downloading**:
   - Checks if the dataset zip file (`HRA_Data.zip`) exists locally.
   - If not, downloads the file from the provided URL.
   - Unzips the file if the `UCI HAR Dataset` folder does not exist.

3. **Data Reading**:
   - Reads various files from the test and train folders of the dataset.
   - Features and activity labels are read and assigned column names.
   - Subject, X (features), and Y (activity codes) data are read for both test and train datasets.

4. **Data Merging**:
   - Merges test and train datasets by rows for X, Y, and subject data.
   - Then merges these datasets by columns to create a single dataset.

5. **Data Transformation**:
   - Selects columns containing mean and standard deviation measurements.
   - Replaces activity codes with descriptive activity names.
   - Renames columns for better readability, replacing abbreviations with full names (e.g., `Acc` to `Accelerometer`).

6. **Data Summarization**:
   - Groups data by subject and activity.
   - Calculates the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject.

7. **Output Generation**:
   - Writes the final tidy dataset to `TidyDB.txt`.

##Variables Description

###Identifier Variables
- `subject`: Identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- `activity`: Type of activity performed by the subject.

###Measurement Variables
- Variables prefixed with `Time` or `Frequency` indicate time and frequency domain signals, respectively.
- Variables containing `Accelerometer` and `Gyroscope` indicate measurements from the respective sensors.
- `Mean` and `STD` in variable names indicate mean and standard deviation measurements.
- Additional variables include `Magnitude`, `Angle`, and `Gravity` related measurements.

###Activity Labels
- WALKING
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
- SITTING
- STANDING
- LAYING

##Final Dataset
The final output `TidyDB.txt` contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The dataset is written as a comma-separated values file.
